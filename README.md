Requirements

Rivet has developed a RESTful API for it's employee directory. You will create a simple, usable, single page React application to view, add and update employees in this directory. The API requires an access token which you will be provided by email.

### Your solution should satisfy the following requirements:

- [x] Allow all employee profiles to be viewed on a single screen
- [x] Allow a single employee profile to be viewed
- [x] Allow a new employee profile to be created
- [x] Allow an existing employee profile to be updated


### Would like to add TECH:
- [ ] Redux *Toolkit*
- [ ] More Typescript checking
- [ ] Styling Library (Reactstrap-boostrap, MaterialUI)
- [ ] Testing (Jest)

-----------

## Features I would add in the future:

- [ ] Login Landing page
- [ ] More custom graphics

#### Main Dashboard
- [ ] Search function
- [ ] Filter option by project, department
- [ ] View by Card, List, FlowChart by senority, Flowchart for specific project senority

#### Cards
- [ ] Links directly to call, and send email from Dashboard. 

#### Profile Page
- [ ] Seperated Information(as well as more targeted info like HR required  info (Birthdate, SSN, Date started, Ect), for more targeted editing
- [ ] List of Current and past projects, for easy viewing
- [ ] Notes would be dated and listed, with an option to delete or update
- [ ] ProfilePage section showing calander and scheduled days off, showing vacation days used/left, ect


## Notes

    Normally I would use a .env file to hide the token and I would also add a custom API variable so that the code in the requests are not so verbose.
